 # Distribution Package
This is a python package used as a calculator for Gaussian and Binomial probability distributions.

# Files
 ## The Gaussian distribution class is for calculating and visualizing a Gaussian distribution.
- Attributes:
	- mean (float) representing the mean value of the distribution
	- stdev (float) representing the standard deviation of the distribution
	- data_list (list of floats) a list of floats extracted from the data file
			
 ## The Binomial distribution class is for calculating and visualizing a Binomial distribution.

- Attributes:
    - mean (float) representing the mean value of the distribution
    - stdev (float) representing the standard deviation of the distribution
    - data_list (list of floats) a list of floats to be extracted from the data file
    - p (float) representing the probability of an event occurring
    - n (int) number of trials

# Installation
```
  pip install python_probability_distributions
```
